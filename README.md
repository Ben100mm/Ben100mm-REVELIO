## 💡 How Payment Distribution Works

Revelio uses an impact-based payment distribution system:

1. **Impact Calculation**: Each creator's impact is calculated based on:
   - Sales volume
   - Product views and engagement
   - Customer ratings and reviews
   - Time contribution

2. **Revenue Pool**: A percentage of each transaction goes into a shared revenue pool

3. **Distribution**: Payments are distributed proportionally based on impact scores

4. **Transparency**: All creators can view their impact metrics and earnings in real-time
