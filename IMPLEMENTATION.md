## How Payment Distribution Works

1. **Transaction Created**: When a buyer purchases a product:
   - 95% goes to creator's earning pool
   - 5% goes to platform fees
   
2. **Impact Score Calculation**: 
   ```
   Impact = (Sales × 0.5) + (Views × 0.3) + (AvgRating × 100 × 0.2)
   ```

3. **Payment Distribution**:
   - All pending transactions are processed
   - Creators receive their earned amounts
   - Total earnings are updated on creator profiles

4. **Impact-Based Bonuses** (optional):
   - Revenue pool is distributed proportionally to impact scores
   - Higher impact = larger bonus share
   - Transparent percentage calculations

## Test Results

```
Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total
Tests:       19 passed, 19 total
```

All tests passing with coverage of:
- Creator model operations
- Product management
- Service layer functionality
- Payment distribution logic

## Running the Application

```bash
